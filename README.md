<b>Bamazon Inventory</b>
<br/>
<ul>Welcome to Bamazon!</ul>
<br/>
<p>This is an Amazon-like storefront that built with MySQL and Node.js</p>
<br/>
<p>Within the <b>Customer</b>portal, you can view the inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase
along with the quantity, and voila! Transaction complete! However, if we do not have enough 
of the selected item in stock deeming us unable to fulfill your purchase, the transaction 
will not go through.</p>
<br/>
<p>Within the <b>Manager</b> portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view all low
inventory (less than 5 items in stock), choose to up the inventory back to the correct amount
needed, and even add new items to your inventory!</p>
